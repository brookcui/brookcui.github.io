        <p>Hello, I'm Rong</p>
        <p>Student, blogger, developer, with great interest in software development.</p>
        <p>I love creating software applications and enjoy the process of prototyping it, designing it, and incrementally building it. I have special interest in building distributed systems related stuff. Also, I am an enthusiastic gopher (great fans of Golang).</p>
        <p>I am starting and updating this blog for sharing gains from my lifelong learning on everything, from coding to philosophy. Meanwhile, I will be really pleased you can learn something or get inspiration somehow from this blog.</p>
